END OF IMPRESSION: Addendum Ends EXAMINATION PERFORMED: CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST WITH CONTRAST 11/22/07 1330 HOURS CLINICAL HISTORY: Dyspnea.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest with nonionic intravenous contrast as per the PEprotocol.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
The lungs demonstrate a right infrahilar mass-like region of consolidation measuring 3.5x3.3cm. There is extensive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion. The lungs demonstrate centrilobular emphysema. There is right basilar atelectasis. There is also a right middle lobe airspace disease which may be secondary to post obstructive atelectasis/pneumonia. Note is also made of a small subpleuralnodule adjacent to the right major fissure, image #98.
There are small left hilar nodes. There is a small pericardialeffusion. There is coronary artery calcification.
Limited exam of the upper abdomen demonstrates no definiteabnormality.
Visualized bones demonstrate degenerative changes of the spine.

FINDINGS: The quality of this study is diminished by extensive respiratory motion throughout the examination and by slightly early CT scan with respect to the contrast bolus. There is no evidence of central or lobar embolism. Imaging at the segmental level is limited in the lower lobes, but no obvious embolus is identified. There are minimal patchy airspace opacities in the right lower lobe suspicious for mild patchy bronchopneumonia. There is a trace amount of right pleural fluid.
