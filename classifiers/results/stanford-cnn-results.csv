Postcontrast images were obtained -***-during the arterial and delayed phases using bolus triggering.  -***-Subsequently, images were reviewed on an independent workstation and -***-multiple reformations were obtained including curved planar, maximal -***-intensity projection and volume rendering.  -***-FINDINGS:  A thoracic aortic stent graft is again demonstrated with -***-its proximal end at the left subclavian take-off extending to the mid -***-descending thoracic aorta.  Just distal to the distal extent  of the -***-thoracic stent graft is a very small natural fenestration leading to -***-contrast filling of the false lumen within the residual descending -***-thoracic aortic dissection.  The dissection is unchanged in -***-appearance and extends into the hypogastric arteries, bilaterally.  -***-Again demonstrated are stents within the origins of the celiac, -***-superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries.  The celiac artery -***-stent extends from the true lumen into the proximal celiac artery.  -***-The branches of the celiac appear patent, including the common -***-hepatic artery and its branches.  The superior mesenteric artery -***-stent extends from the true lumen into the proximal superior -***-mesenteric artery.  There is narrowing of the contrast opacified -***-portion of the superior mesenteric artery just distal to the stent.  -***-This is compatible with the recent reported narrowing on angiogram.  -***-Surrounding the area of contrast opacification is a concentric mildly -***-asymmetric noncontrast opacified region which appears high in density -***-on the noncontrast images, consistent with clotted blood.  This may -***-represent thrombosis of the false lumen or thrombosis of intramural -***-hemorrhage within the superior mesenteric artery.  There is contrast -***-opacification, however, and the distal branches appear unremarkable.  -***-The left renal artery originates from the true lumen.  The right -***-renal artery is stented.  The proximal origin of the stent appears -***-within the false lumen and extends into the midright renal artery -***-with narrowing of the distal stent and no definite contrast -***-opacification distal to the stent.  There is a right accessory artery -***-originating inferiorly from the false lumen demonstrating contrast -***-opacification and consequent enhancement of the inferior right -***-kidney.  The superior and midright kidney demonstrate no definite -***-contrast enhancement with areas of striated high density on the -***-noncontrast study within the inferior portion of the kidney likely -***-reflecting a prolonged nephrogram in the setting of ATN.  The -***-inferior mesenteric artery originates from the false lumen and -***-appears patent with contrast opacification.  Again the dissection -***-flaps extend into the proximal hypogastric arteries, bilaterally.  -***-The proximal common femoral artery and its branches appear -***-unremarkable.  There are postaccess changes within the right groin -***-again demonstrated.-***-Though the study is not optimized for the pulmonary arterial phase -***-there is adequate contrast opacification to demonstrate a distal -***-segmental pulmonary arterial embolism to the left upper lobe.  No -***-other pulmonary emboli are seen.  -***-There is a right subclavian vascular catheter with its tip located in -***-the right brachiocephalic vein.  There is a right internal jugular -***-introducer with its tip located in the low superior vena cava.  There -***-is a feeding tube with its tip located in the proximal jejunum.  -***-There is a rectal tube and a Foley catheter.  -***-Evaluation of the intraabdominal organs is limited by timing of -***-contrast administration.  Specifically, evaluation for bowel -***-enhancement is limited.  There are no definite findings to suggest -***-continued bowel ischemia though there is some bowel wall thickening -***-and mesenteric fat stranding within the right lower quadrant presumed -***-to represent postoperative change after the patient's partial right -***-colectomy.  There is a staple line along the ileocecectomy.  There -***-are postoperative changes of midline laparotomy.  There are irregular -***-foci of soft tissue stranding within the anterior abdominal wall -***-which may relate to injection sites. -***-Limited evaluation of the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands remains -***-unremarkable.  There is a gallstone within the gallbladder.  The -***-gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.  There is a geographic area of -***-relative hypodensity extending inferior to the pancreatic neck which -***-is nonspecific and also may relate to prior embolic insults.  The -***-pancreas is otherwise unremarkable.  There is nonenhancement of the -***-superior mid right kidney.  There is a striated appearance of -***-enhancement of the inferior right kidney.  The enhancement of the -***-left kidney is grossly symmetrical.  There is no hydronephrosis.   -***-There is mild right perinephric fat stranding.  -***-Small likely reactive mesenteric lymph nodes are again demonstrated.  -***-There is trace intraabdominal free fluid.

There is tumor -***-thrombus at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium.  -***-Incidental note of lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. -***-Significant coronary artery atherosclerotic disease is present.  -***-Aortic valvular calcifications are noted. No pericardial effusion. -***-The descending thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber and -***-demonstrates atherosclerosis. The esophagus and gastroesophageal -***-junction are grossly unremarkable. -***-The pulmonary artery is within normal size limits.  Evaluation of the -***-pulmonary arterial system is limited secondary to patient respiratory -***-motion and phase of contrast opacification, however there are -***-bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial filling -***-defects compatible with pulmonary emboli.  Given the tumor thrombus -***-within the right atrium, findings are compatible with tumor emboli.-***-There is a small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis -***-in the right lung base.

There is a left chest wall dual lead -***-pacer with the pacer wires in the right atrium and right ventricle. -***-There are stents within the left anterior descending and obtuse -***-marginal coronary arteries. Specific evaluation of the coronary -***-arteries is limited given the technique of this study. There is -***-atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta and its branches, -***-including  calcific and noncalcific atheroma. There is a penetrating -***-atherosclerotic ulcer at the aortic isthmus pointing inferolaterally -***-with a resultant pseudoaneurysm. The maximal dimension of the -***-pseudoaneurysm measure 70 x 72 mm, which is increased from about 65 x -***-56 mm on the December study. There is partial opacification of the -***-pseudoaneurysm consistent with pressurization. Evaluation of the -***-descending thoracic aorta demonstrates no evidence of dissection or -***-aneurysm. Incidental note is made of a focal dissection within the -***-abdominal aorta at the level of the kidneys, which is stable when -***-compared t the prior study. The aorta is not enlarged in this region. -***-There is subsegmental pulmonary embolism within the left lower lobe -***-posterobasal segments. There are no other pulmonary emboli. The -***-previously described right lung pulmonary emboli are not visualized -***-on the current study. There is no central pulmonary embolism. -***-There are moderate pericardial and small left pleural effusions again -***-demonstrated. There is atelectasis in the left lung base again -***-demonstrated. The lungs are clear of consolidation. There are -***-scattered areas of mucus plugging.

There is no intrathoracic or axillary -***-lymphadenopathy. -***-The thyroid gland demonstrates heterogeneity and areas of hypodense -***-nodules. Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited by timing of -***-scope of contrast administration. Limited evaluation of the upper -***-abdomen demonstrates tiny hypodensities within the liver, which are -***-too small for definitive characterization but are stable from the -***-prior study. There is a vague contrast blush within the right lobe of -***-the liver next to the dome, which likely represents arteriovenous -***-shunting and was not definitely seen on the prior study. This lesion -***-is incompletely evaluated. -***-There are numerous tiny hyperdensities within the kidneys, -***-bilaterally. These are most compatible with simple cysts, though some -***-are too small for definitive characterization. Gallstones are again -***-demonstrated in the gallbladder.

No central -***-pulmonary embolism is identified.  No aortic dissection is -***-identified.  -***-There is significant atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta, -***-including calcifications and multiple irregular atheromas.

There is enlargement of -***-the left atrium and mild enlargement of the left ventricle.  Mildly -***-decreased perfusion involving the subendocardial portion of the left -***-ventricular apical wall is suggestive of infarction.  A right -***-axillary arterial catheter and a left internal jugular central venous -***-catheter are noted.  The heart and thoracic vasculature are otherwise -***-unremarkable.

In the right axilla, there is a -***-somewhat ill-defined mass which measures 3.6 x 2.9 cm on axial image -***-64 of series 4.  This is also of unclear etiology and may represent a -***-hematoma given the central line in this region.  However, a nodal -***-mass is also not excluded.  -***-Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates fairly extensive, -***-scattered ground glass opacification, some of which appear -***-geographic.

Within the right lung base, there -***-are two more focal, peripheral consolidations which may represent -***-atelectasis, though infection, and in this setting, infarction are -***-also possible.  Paraseptal emphysema is visualized mostly within the -***-upper lobes.  -***-A limb of the left adrenal gland appears thickened and nodular.  The -***-right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  The liver, gallbladder, right -***-kidney, spleen, pancreas and visualized bowel are unremarkable.

In addition, there is preferential bronchial-***-arterial hypertrophy supplying the left lung as well as multiple-***-large entercostals on the left side compared to the right.

The left pulmonary veins are also very small and-***-scarred, especially the superior branches.-***-On the right side, there is medialization of the hilar structures-***-secondary to scarring. There is a 1 cm filling defect within the-***-right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arterial branch which may-***-represent a pulmonary embolus.

Renal enhancement is prompt and symmetric bilaterally-***-without evidence of perfusion abnormality. Multiple tiny peripheral-***-low attenuation lesions are present within both kidneys, the-***-majority of which are too small to further characterize. A small-***-low attenuation lesion near the dome of the liver is also too small-***-to further characterize.-***-Postoperative changes of bilateral total hip arthroplasty are-***-demonstrated with multifocal complex fluid collection adjacent to-***-the left hip. The fluid collection along the medial aspect of the-***-left iliac bone, adjacent to the left iliopsoas musculature causes-***-mild medial displacement of the adjacent left external iliac artery-***-without evidence of arterial compromise. Allowing for differences-***-in technique, this collection is not significantly changed since-***-abdomen and pelvis CT from 5/31/2004.

Mild expansion of the adjacent-***-iliopsoas musculature suggests some degree of prior hemorrhage,-***-which is unchanged since the prior examination.-***-Extensive left lower extremity swelling and soft tissue edema is-***-again demonstrated, some of which is likely related to previously-***-described left femoral deep venous thrombosis (not well visualized-***-on today's examination due to imaged phase of contrast-***-enhancement).-***-Mild bilateral infrainguinal atherosclerotic changes are-***-demonstrated. Normal right lower extremity arterial runoff is-***-demonstrated with three vessels runoff to the ankle and two vessel-***-flow to the foot via the dorsalis pedis and distal posterior tibial-***-arteries.-***-The left common femoral, superficial femoral, and deep femoral-***-arteries are patent and of normal caliber.

At Stanford, 2.5 mm axial images were obtained through the-***-chest, abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast.-***-Subsequently, 1.25 mm retrospectively ECG gated axial images-***-through the chest were obtained and continued into the abdomen and-***-pelvis. Delayed images were then obtained through the chest.-***-Image quality of the arterial phase is limited secondary to poor-***-bolus timing. Images were reviewed on a 3D workstation, and-***-subsequently reformatted images were supplied by the 3D laboratory.-***-FINDINGS:-***-Endotracheal tube is present with tip above the level of the-***-carina.-***-AORTA:-***-There is bovine aortic arch anatomy. A type B aortic dissection is-***-demonstrated. The entry tear is likely located in the distal-***-thoracic or proximal abdominal aorta with propogation both-***-retrograde and anterograde.

Compared with the prior outside-***-study, the previously demonstrated fenestration and slight contrast-***-enhancement within the false lumen is no longer present. There is-***-no flow demonstrated in the false lumen, neither on arterial phase-***-nor in delayed phase consistent with thrombosis of the false lumen.-***-This thrombosed false lumen extends inferiorly to the level of the-***-hiatus where there is an abrupt transition to patent true and false-***-luminae with near complete intimal separation and a free floating-***-true lumen. The maximum dimension of the descending thoracic aorta-***-at the level of the pulmonary arteries measures 2.7 x 2.9 cm.-***-Within the abdomen, the celiac artery arises from the true lumen.-***-The celiac origin is narrowed, but this is by the median arcuate-***-ligament, not due to the dissection. The superior mesenteric-***-artery arises from the true lumen. The inferior mesenteric artery-***-also arises from the true lumen. There are two right renal-***-arteries and two left renal arteries, both of which arise from the-***-true lumen. The dissection propagates distally and extends into-***-both common iliac arteries. There is thrombosis of the false lumen-***-of the right common iliac artery beginning at its origin. This-***-thrombosis extends to the distal right common iliac artery where-***-the dissection terminates. The true lumen in the right common-***-iliac artery is markedly compressed by the thrombosed false lumen.-***-There is extensive atheroma of the right external iliac artery.-***-Within the left common iliac artery the dissection propagates to-***-the middle of the vessel where it terminates.-***-THE REMAINDER OF THE CHEST:-***-There is prominent back filling of left paravertebral veins but no-***-evidence of venous anatomic obstruction.

Numerous pulmonary nodules involving-***-all lobes are seen, ranging from subcentimeter size up to 2.3 cm-***-(right upper lobe, image 250 of series 2). Comparison with the-***-images of the lung base from the prior study of October 20th, 2005-***-suggests likely interval progression of pulmonary nodules since the-***-prior study. There has been interval development of a moderate to-***-large right pleural effusion, associated with approximately 50%-***-atelectasis of the right lower lobe and additional milder-***-atelectatic changes of the right middle lobe. The airways appear-***-essentially patent. Shotty axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes are-***-identified, none of which meets CT size criteria for pathologic-***-significance.

There is redemonstration of discrete high attenuation-***-material within the masses, consistent with prior-***-chemoembolization. Associated with the masses, there is associated-***-compression of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava, as well as the-***-suprahepatic inferior vena cava, with venous return through the-***-azygous and hemiazygous system.

Rule out pulmonary embolus.-***-COMPARISON: None.-***-TECHNIQUE: Multiple 1.25 mm axial images of the chest were-***-obtained with subsequent 5 mm axial images from the IVC bifurcation-***-to the deep venous system of the lower extremities after IV-***-contrast administration.-***-FINDINGS: The pulmonary artery trunk is markedly enlarged-***-measuring 4.2 cm in diameter. The right and left main pulmonary-***-arteries as well as the peripheral branches are also enlarged-***-relative to their accompanying bronchi consistent with pulmonary-***-hypertension and shunt vascularity. There is a normal distribution-***-of the pulmonary arteries without filling defects. A normal-***-appearing left-sided aortic arch is present and the aorta is normal-***-in caliber and appearance throughout its course. The right and-***-left coronary arteries are patent and arise from the aorta. The-***-supra-aortic great vessels are normal in caliber with an aberrant-***-right subclavian artery present which takes off the distal-***-transverse aortic arch at the fourth branch and courses posterior-***-to the trachea and esophagus without mass effect on the trachea.-***-The pulmonary veins are normal in caliber and take a normal course-***-draining into the left atrium. A right-sided SVC drains to the-***-anterior right atrium. A morphologic right ventricle and left-***-ventricle are present with normal cardiac status. There is marked-***-right ventricular hypertrophy associated with the large-***-perimembranous ventricular septal defect measuring approximately 2-***-cm in size. Additionally, two small muscular ventricular septal-***-communications are visualized. The endocardial cushion is intact.-***-There is associated slight atrial enlargement with normal left-***-atrial size. Due to artifact, whether an intra-atrial-***-communication is present cannot be evaluated. No pericardial-***-effusion.-***-The lung parenchyma demonstrates diffuse subtle ground-glass-***-opacities in a centrilobular distribution which could be secondary-***-to pulmonary hypertension versus foci of microhemorrhage,-***-infection, or inflammation/hypersensitivity.
