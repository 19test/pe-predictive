    "# Predicting Pulmonary Embolism from Reports\n",
    "This notebook will summarize early models to predict pulmonary embolism, PE, from radiology reports. For all analyses, we aim to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chapman's method (rule-based PEFinder) against Stanford data, and reproduce his result with his data\n",
    "2. Stanford (machine learning) method against Stanford and Chapman data\n",
    "3. Compare the two methods, and for Stanford, test using impressions (as Chapman did) and full reports\n",
    "\n",
    "This early result is just showing a Stanford method against Stanford (impression and full reports) and Chapman data, as we need to talk with Brian (Chapman) tomorrow (Friday 10/14) to make sure we can properly reproduce what he did. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "The [data preprocessing](https://github.com/radinformatics/pe-predictive/blob/master/classifiers/0.reportsPrep.py) for Stanford included parsing the Stanford data (a file called `final_3.csv`, note this is not acceptable for future work) into the exact format of the Chapman data. This means that:\n",
    "- `disease_state_labels` that include \"definitely positive\" ... \"definitely_negative\" are mapped onto \"Neg\" and \"Pos\", the variable `disease_state`\n",
    "- `uncertainty_labels` that include \"definitely negative\" ... \"definitely positive\" are mapped onto \"Yes\" and \"No\" and nan, the variable `uncertainty`\n",
    "\n",
    "and while all batches are saved, for the actual analyses we don't use batch 1, as it (as reported by Yu) is not independent of batch 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree Ensemble Learning\n",
    "For the [Stanford analyses](https://github.com/radinformatics/pe-predictive/blob/master/classifiers/1.predictStanford.py) I do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter down data matrix, X, to either impressions or full reports, and y (labels) to some metric we are interested in (eg, disease_state). \n",
    "2. Use sklearn [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) to extract tokens and counts from the reports. I set the `ngram_range` to (1,2), meaning we will use one or two words as features. I set `stop_words` to `english` meaning that a pre-defined list of English stop words will be removed from the tokens (eg, the, a)\n",
    "3. Split the data into 10 training and test sets (10 fold cross validation)\n",
    "4. For each training and test:\n",
    "    - Build an [extra-trees-classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html) on the training, with `class_weight` balanced meaning that it takes frequency of the labels into account.\n",
    "    - Test on the test set\n",
    "    - Save results, including reports we got wrong, importance ranking of top 100 features, and set sizes\n",
    "    \n",
    "The remainder of this report will detail these results"

In addition, there is mosaic perfusion seen in both-***-lungs, particularly in the upper lobes. Emphysema is also noted-***-scattered throughout both lung fields. There is a 3 mm nodule-***-noted, which is nonspecific in appearance. This does not appear to-***-be calcified. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There is mild-***-bronchial wall thickening seen, particularly in the lower lobes.-***-Patient appears to be status post aortic valve replacement. Median-***-sternotomy is identified. No significant mediastinal-***-lymphadenopathy is identified. No pleural or pericardial effusions-***-are seen. Aneurysmal dilatation of the right subclavian artery is-***-seen measuring 1.6 cm.-***-There is moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation along with-***-significant extrahepatic common biliary ductal dilatation. The-***-pancreatic duct also appears dilated. The pancreatic head is not-***-completely imaged on today's study. A biphasic CT, such as a-***-pancreatic protocol may be helpful in evaluation. There is high-***-grade stenosis versus occlusion at the origin of the celiac axis.-***-The left gastric has a separate origin with moderate stenosis seen-***-at the origin of the left gastric artery. Arterial calcification-***-of the proper hepatic artery and splenic artery is seen via-***-multiple collaterals from the proximal superior mesenteric artery.-***-No evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Visualized portions of the-***-small bowel and colon demonstrate normal caliber. There is-***-eccentric thrombus identified within the distal infrarenal aorta.-***-IMPRESSION:-***-1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM OR DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS.-***-2. ENLARGEMENT OF BILATERAL PULMONARY ARTERIES AND CENTRAL-***-PULMONARY ARTERIES IS NOTED. THERE IS TAPERING OF THE PULMONARY-***-ARTERIES MORE DISTALLY. THERE IS ASSOCIATED MOSAIC PERFUSION SEEN-***-THROUGHOUT BOTH LUNG FIELDS.-***-3. MILD BRONCHIAL WALL THICKENING. 3 MM RIGHT UPPER LOBE NODULE,-***-WHICH IS NONSPECIFIC IN APPEARANCE.-***-4. PATIENT IS STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT. GLOBAL-***-CARDIOMEGALY IS NOTED.-***-5. HIGH-GRADE STENOSIS VERSUS OCCLUSION AT THE ORIGIN OF THE-***-CELIAC AXIS WITH MULTIPLE COLLATERALS ARISING FROM THE PANCREATIC-***-OR DUODENAL ARCADE SEEN SUPPLYING THE SPLENIC ARTERY AND THE PROPER-***-HEPATIC ARTERY VIA THE SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. THERE IS A-***-SEPARATE ORIGIN OF THE LEFT GASTRIC ARTERY FROM THE AORTA, WHICH-***-ALSO DEMONSTRATES MODERATE STENOSIS AT ITS ORIGIN.-***-6. THERE IS AN 1.2 CM CALCIFIED ANEURYSM SEEN WITHIN THE PROXIMAL-***-SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY.-***-7. INTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DUCTAL DILATATION WITH PANCREATIC DUCTAL-***-DILATATION AND COMMON BILE DUCT, WHICH IS DILATED. THIS IS-***-SUSPICIOUS FOR A MASS WITHIN THE PANCREATIC HEAD. THE PANCREATIC-***-HEAD IS NOT FULLY IMAGED ON TODAY'S STUDY. A PANCREATIC CT-***-PROTOCOL VERSUS BIPHASIC CT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN FURTHER EVALUATION.-***-8. THESE RESULTS WERE DISCUSSED WITH DR. SHAH ON 5/25/04 AT 1430-***-HOURS.-***-END OF IMPRESSION:-***-SUMMARY: 2-***-I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree-***-with the report transcribed above.-***-By: Geoffrey D.
