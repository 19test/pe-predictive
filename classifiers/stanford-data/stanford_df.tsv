157	ML_PE55136	1030017	3094	CT ANGIO CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  -***-There is partial thrombus seen in the left internal jugular vein, the left innominate vein, and the left subclavian vein. There is loss of opacification of the left innominate vein in its course anterior to the aorta.  The left axillary vein is patent. There is preferential venous  drainage through the internal mammary veins and paraspinal collaterals.  Drainage into the superior vena cava is directly through the right internal mammary vein and via the azygos vein. -***-Evaluation of the main pulmonary artery shows a normal branching pattern without evidence of filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.  There are three pulmonary veins on the right and two pulmonary veins on the left, all of which are patent.  There is no pericardial effusion.  -***-Allowing for technique, there is a similar paratracheal and precarinal, and aortopulmonary mass which is of low density.  -***-Again seen is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with opacification of a portion of the left lower lobe with air bronchograms likely representing atelectasis, however, infection cannot be excluded.

Postcontrast images were obtained -***-during the arterial and delayed phases using bolus triggering.  -***-Subsequently, images were reviewed on an independent workstation and -***-multiple reformations were obtained including curved planar, maximal -***-intensity projection and volume rendering.  -***-FINDINGS:  A thoracic aortic stent graft is again demonstrated with -***-its proximal end at the left subclavian take-off extending to the mid -***-descending thoracic aorta.  Just distal to the distal extent  of the -***-thoracic stent graft is a very small natural fenestration leading to -***-contrast filling of the false lumen within the residual descending -***-thoracic aortic dissection.  The dissection is unchanged in -***-appearance and extends into the hypogastric arteries, bilaterally.  -***-Again demonstrated are stents within the origins of the celiac, -***-superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries.  The celiac artery -***-stent extends from the true lumen into the proximal celiac artery.  -***-The branches of the celiac appear patent, including the common -***-hepatic artery and its branches.  The superior mesenteric artery -***-stent extends from the true lumen into the proximal superior -***-mesenteric artery.  There is narrowing of the contrast opacified -***-portion of the superior mesenteric artery just distal to the stent.  -***-This is compatible with the recent reported narrowing on angiogram.  -***-Surrounding the area of contrast opacification is a concentric mildly -***-asymmetric noncontrast opacified region which appears high in density -***-on the noncontrast images, consistent with clotted blood.  This may -***-represent thrombosis of the false lumen or thrombosis of intramural -***-hemorrhage within the superior mesenteric artery.  There is contrast -***-opacification, however, and the distal branches appear unremarkable.  -***-The left renal artery originates from the true lumen.  The right -***-renal artery is stented.  The proximal origin of the stent appears -***-within the false lumen and extends into the midright renal artery -***-with narrowing of the distal stent and no definite contrast -***-opacification distal to the stent.  There is a right accessory artery -***-originating inferiorly from the false lumen demonstrating contrast -***-opacification and consequent enhancement of the inferior right -***-kidney.  The superior and midright kidney demonstrate no definite -***-contrast enhancement with areas of striated high density on the -***-noncontrast study within the inferior portion of the kidney likely -***-reflecting a prolonged nephrogram in the setting of ATN.  The -***-inferior mesenteric artery originates from the false lumen and -***-appears patent with contrast opacification.  Again the dissection -***-flaps extend into the proximal hypogastric arteries, bilaterally.  -***-The proximal common femoral artery and its branches appear -***-unremarkable.  There are postaccess changes within the right groin -***-again demonstrated.-***-Though the study is not optimized for the pulmonary arterial phase -***-there is adequate contrast opacification to demonstrate a distal -***-segmental pulmonary arterial embolism to the left upper lobe.  No -***-other pulmonary emboli are seen.  -***-There is a right subclavian vascular catheter with its tip located in -***-the right brachiocephalic vein.  There is a right internal jugular -***-introducer with its tip located in the low superior vena cava.  There -***-is a feeding tube with its tip located in the proximal jejunum.  -***-There is a rectal tube and a Foley catheter.  -***-Evaluation of the intraabdominal organs is limited by timing of -***-contrast administration.  Specifically, evaluation for bowel -***-enhancement is limited.  There are no definite findings to suggest -***-continued bowel ischemia though there is some bowel wall thickening -***-and mesenteric fat stranding within the right lower quadrant presumed -***-to represent postoperative change after the patient's partial right -***-colectomy.  There is a staple line along the ileocecectomy.  There -***-are postoperative changes of midline laparotomy.  There are irregular -***-foci of soft tissue stranding within the anterior abdominal wall -***-which may relate to injection sites. -***-Limited evaluation of the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands remains -***-unremarkable.  There is a gallstone within the gallbladder.  The -***-gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.  There is a geographic area of -***-relative hypodensity extending inferior to the pancreatic neck which -***-is nonspecific and also may relate to prior embolic insults.  The -***-pancreas is otherwise unremarkable.  There is nonenhancement of the -***-superior mid right kidney.  There is a striated appearance of -***-enhancement of the inferior right kidney.  The enhancement of the -***-left kidney is grossly symmetrical.  There is no hydronephrosis.   -***-There is mild right perinephric fat stranding.  -***-Small likely reactive mesenteric lymph nodes are again demonstrated.  -***-There is trace intraabdominal free fluid.  Pelvic organs appear -***-unremarkable.  -***-Osseous structures again demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes.  -***-Subacute right-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated.  -***-IMPRESSION:     -***-1.

Evaluate response.-***-TECHNIQUE:  Following the uneventful administration of intravenous -***-contrast, spiral CT was performed from the thoracic inlet to the -***-pubic symphysis and multiplanar reconstructed images were submitted -***-for further evaluation.-***-FINDINGS:  -***-CHEST:  There is a tiny hypodensity within the posterior aspect of -***-the left thyroid lobe which is unchanged.  Note is made of asymmetric -***-breast tissue within the upper outer aspect of the right breast (for -***-example, series 2, image 27).  There are no enlarged intrathoracic or -***-axillary lymph nodes.  No pleural or pericardial effusion.  The -***-central airways are patent.  Note is made of filling defects within -***-the left lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into multiple -***-segmental branches (series 2, image 27).

Please note that the study -***-technique is not optimal for pulmonary embolus detection.  Evaluation -***-of the lung parenchyma demonstrates mild apical parenchymal/pleural -***-thickening, unchanged.  Scattered sub 4 mm nodules are unchanged -***-compared to the prior study.  In addition, there has been interval -***-development of minimal pleural nodularity within the right hemithorax -***-(for example, series 3, image 62 and series 3, image 73).  Some of -***-these areas of pleural nodularity are associated with adjacent ground -***-glass opacity.-***-ABDOMEN:  Again demonstrated are multiple hypodense hepatic lesions -***-compatible with metastases.  There has been interval decrease in size -***-of several of these lesions; for example, an 18 x 14 mm segment III -***-lesion (series 7, image 16) previously measured 28 x 20 mm.  Within -***-the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe, a 15 x 19 mm lesion -***-previously measured 26 x 21 mm (series 7, image 24 of the current -***-study).  A 17 x 13 mm lesion within the posterior segment of the -***-right hepatic lobe (series 7, image 27) previously measured 20 x 17 -***-mm.  A 14 x 10 mm lesion within the anterior segment of the right -***-hepatic lobe (series 7, image 29) previously measured 17 x 15 mm.  -***-Stable hypodensity within the posterior aspect of the right hepatic -***-lobe immediately posterior to the IVC demonstrates peripheral nodular -***-enhancement, likely representing a hemangioma (series 7, image 17).  -***-Another subcentimeter focus within the left hepatic lobe (series 7, -***-image 12) also demonstrates imaging characteristics compatible with -***-hemangioma.  Tiny, scattered hypodensities within the liver are too -***-small to characterize.

Again seen is a short segment dissection flap which starts -***-at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta just proximal to the -***-origin of the left common carotid artery and terminates just distal -***-to the takeoff of the right subclavian artery. No evidence of further -***-extension of the dissection flap or intramural hematoma. The -***-ascending aorta measures 22 mm, which is unchanged from prior. -***- The main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. Again seen is an -***-area of narrowing at the origin of the left main pulmonary artery, -***-with narrowest dimension measuring 7 mm. Within the posterobasal -***-segmental pulmonary artery of the right lower lobe, there is a focal -***-filling defect, consistent with a pulmonary embolism (series 6, image -***-227).

Contiguous axial images were -***-reconstructed at various slice thicknesses.  Some combination of -***-sagittal, coronal and/or maximum intensity projection reconstructions -***-were also generated.-***-Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol -***-[mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 23.99, 14.02  mGy.  The -***-estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is:  476.82 mGy-cm.-***-NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose -***-Index' (CTDIvol)-***-given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in -***-mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to -***-estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a -***-reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- -***-or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size -***-and other factors.-***-FINDINGS: -***-Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arterial circulation is -***-excellent for assessment for PE. Evaluation is markedly limited by -***-respiratory motion, however there is no obvious filling defects to -***-suggest pulmonary emboli to the level of the lobar arteries. -***-No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Coronary artery -***-calcifications are seen.  Heart is normal in appearance.  No -***-pericardial effusion.  Aorta has a normal caliber and course. Main -***-pulmonary artery is not enlarged.  -***-The lungs demonstrate severe centrilobular emphysema bilaterally.  -***-Airways in the right lower lobe are inspissated and concerning for -***-aspiration.

CT is requested for restaging. -***-COMPARISON: CT chest 9/25/12 and multiple others back to 5/25/05.-***-TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were acquired through the thorax -***-following the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast at 1 -***-mm and 5 mm slice thicknesses.  Sagittal, coronal and maximum -***-intensity projection reformations were performed.-***-DOSE: Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose -***-(CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 10.0 mGy.  The -***-estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is:  364 mGy-cm.-***-Note: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose -***-Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length -***-Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from -***-the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical -***-study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may -***-therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's -***-absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.-***-CONTRAST: Omnipaque 350, 62 mL.-***-FINDINGS: -***-The visualized soft tissues of the lower neck and thyroid are -***-unremarkable. A left subclavian central venous medication infusion -***-port terminates in the mid-SVC.  The port access is directed -***-superiorly.  -***-The heart size and morphology is normal.  No significant coronary -***-artery calcifications are present. There is no pericardial effusion.  -***-The great vessels are normal in course and caliber. Although not a -***-dedicated CT pulmonary angiogram, there are no filling defects to -***-suggestion pulmonary embolism.  -***-No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary -***-lymphadenopathy. -***-There is interval enlargement of multiple pulmonary nodules, -***-concerning for disease progression.

A -***-right lower lobe nodule located near the irradiated nodule in the -***-right lower lobe now measures 14 mm (4/164), previously 9 mm.   A -***-9-mm nodular focus in the anterior left upper lobe (4/62) has -***-intervally increased in density from September 2012, at which time it -***-was mixed solid and ground glass. -***-A left lower lobe nodule with fiducial markers demonstrates increased -***-nodular consolidation measuring 1.6 cm (4/136); changes in the -***-appearance this lesion may represent evolving postradiation change, -***-however, the increased convex nature is suspicious for local -***-progression.  A right lower lobe lesion with fiducial markers (4/172) -***-additionally demonstrates increasing consolidation, with nodular -***-component measuring 2.4 x 1.9 cm; this likely represents -***-post-radiation change and local recurrence is felt less likely.  -***-PET/CT may be helpful for assessment of these lesions, if clinically -***-appropriate. -***-Several new, rounded subcentimeter nodules are present in the left -***-upper lung; though they are tiny, they are suspicious for new -***-metastases. These include: a 2-mm nodule in the apical left upper -***-lobe (4/77), 2-mm nodule in the left upper lobe (4/83), and 2-mm -***-sub-pleural nodule in the lateral left upper lobe (4/96).-***-There are changes of postradiation fibrosis in the anterior right -***-middle lobe and right upper lobe.  Ground glass in the right apex is -***-similar to that seen previously, and also may represent postradiation -***-change.  -***-Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates a small hiatal -***-hernia, but is otherwise unremarkable.  There are changes of -***-bilateral mastectomy, and right axillary node dissection.  Bilateral -***-breast implants are intact.-***-There is a healing, subacute nondisplaced fracture of the lateral -***-right third rib (4/66).

No significant-***-mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  Mild calcifications-***-within the aorta are noted, consistent with atherosclerotic disease.-***-Multiple segmental and subsegmental filling defects within the-***-pulmonary arteries supplying the right middle, right lower, and left-***-lower lobes are seen, consistent with multiple pulmonary emboli.  The-***-largest of these is a near occlusive right lower lobe segmental-***-pulmonary embolism (Series 3, Image 179).  Small to moderate-***-bilateral pleural effusions are seen with interlobular septal-***-thickening, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Bilateral lower lobe-***-atelectasis versus consolidation is noted.  Scattered patchy-***-opacities are noted most heavily concentrated within the left upper-***-lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe.  A focus of poor enhancement of-***-the lung parenchyma in the right lower lobe is noted, which is-***-concerning for pulmonary infarct.  Scattered apical bulla are noted.-***-A small to moderate pericardial effusion is noted.-***-ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Again noted is the intrahepatic biliary ductal-***-dilatation and pneumobilia.  The extrahepatic biliary stent is-***-unchanged in position with the proximal end within the common bile-***-duct and the distal end in the duodenum.-***-Heterogeneous enhancement of the spleen is noted on the portal venous-***-phase with the spleen becoming homogeneous on the delayed phase.  The-***-patient is status post cholecystectomy.-***-Slight interval decrease in size of the approximately 1.5 x 1.0 cm-***-ill-defined hypodense mass within the pancreatic head/uncinate-***-process are noted with unchanged gold fiducial markers.  Persistent-***-atrophy of the remainder of the pancreas is again seen.  Unchanged-***-thrombus in the proximal superior mesenteric vein adjacent to the-***-portal splenic confluence is again seen.  Otherwise the remainder of-***-the portal vein, splenic vein, and portal splenic confluence is-***-patent.-***-Adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Kidneys demonstrate symmetric-***-contrast enhancement and excretion.  Subcentimeter hypodensities are-***-seen within the bilateral kidneys, which are unchanged.-***-Interval decrease in the previously noted multiple dilated small-***-bowel loops are seen.  An unchanged approximately 2.1 x 0.9 cm-***-partially calcified mass within the root of the mesentery is again-***-seen with persistent tethering of the adjacent small bowel mesentery.-***-The partially calcified mesenteric mass is not significantly changed-***-compared to the prior examination.  Scattered areas of thickening-***-within the small bowel and colon are noted, which are slightly-***-increased compared to the prior examination.-***-Within the pelvis, interval increase in the moderate pelvic free-***-fluid is seen.  Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of-***-diverticulitis is seen.

A right -***-anterior chest wall catheter is identified, compatible with a VP -***-shunt. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The -***-thoracic aorta and main pulmonary artery normal in caliber. While not -***-a dedicated evaluation for pulmonary emboli, there are no large -***-central filling defects within the pulmonary dural vasculature.-***-No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axilla or -***-lymphadenopathy is identified. There is decreased size of the -***-previously identified prominent left hilar lymph node.-***-The trachea and central airways are patent. No focal consolidation or -***-effusions identified. Again noted are numerous pulmonary nodules, -***-which are overall stable in number. Some these nodules demonstrate -***-interval decrease in size.

An additional 20-mm nodule in the -***-right lower lobe previously measured 23 mm (series 4, image 107). No -***-new pulmonary nodules or masses are identified.-***-ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:-***-The large heterogeneous right renal mass, compatible with patient's -***-known renal cell carcinoma, is not significantly changed in size -***-compared to prior and measures 14 x 13 by 15 cm (previously 14 x 13.4 -***-x 15.1 cm). This mass demonstrates a large central necrotic portion, -***-which is not significantly changed compared to prior. Direct invasion -***-of this mass into segments 5 and 6 of the liver may be slightly -***-increased compared to prior, but exact measurements are difficult to -***-provide given ill-defined margins. The right renal vein and IVC -***-remain patent without evidence of tumor thrombus. Numerous -***-parasitizing vessels are again noted around this dominant renal mass. -***-The right adrenal gland is normal in morphology without evidence of -***-metastatic disease.-***-The left adrenal gland and left kidney are unremarkable without -***-evidence of mass.-***-The gallbladder demonstrates thickening of the fundus, which is -***-unchanged compared to prior, and likely reflects focal -***-adenomyomatosis. Otherwise, the gallbladder is unremarkable. The -***-spleen and pancreas are normal in size and morphology.-***-Visualized loops of bowel demonstrate normal course and caliber -***-throughout. There is no evidence of obstruction.-***-There has been overall mixed response of peritoneal carcinomatosis. -***-For example, peritoneal implants in the pelvis have slightly -***-decreased in size, with the right pelvic implant measuring 33 x 19 mm -***-compared to prior measurement of 35 x 22 mm (series 5, image 296) and -***-the left pelvic implant measuring 19 x 35 mm compared to prior -***-measurement of 24 x 35 mm (series 5, image 299). However, there has -***-been progression of peritoneal implants in the left abdomen. A soft -***-tissue implant anterior to the left colon now measures 12 mm compared -***-to prior measurement of 10 mm (series 5, image 237). In addition, -***-there is a new implant lateral to the left colon measuring 11 mm -***-(series 5, image 233). Many of these peritoneal implants notably are -***-identified along the tract of the patient's VP shunt. There is -***-increased fluid in the pelvis, without areas of increased peritoneal -***-nodularity, which may be secondary to the shunt itself.-***-MUSCULOSKELETAL:-***-No osseous metastasis are identified in the chest. There has been -***-overall progression of osseous metastasis involving the pelvis. The -***-large osseous metastasis centered on the left sacroiliac joint -***-demonstrates increased size, enhancement, and osseous destruction. -***-Notably, new areas of cortical breakthrough are identified in the -***-left sacrum (series 5, image 247).

28495	ML_PE42659	395866415	26089	CT Chest and Abdomen with Contrast,  2/16/2012 4:09 PM-***-History: 71 year-old female without known liver disease presents with -***-a large hepatic mass and increasing abdominal fullness.  Outside -***-imaging compatible with hepatocellular carcinoma.  Further imaging -***-was requested to evaluate for resectability.-***-Comparison: No prior available at this institution.-***-Technique: After the uncomplicated intravenous administration of 116 -***-ml of Isovue-300, contiguous axial CT images were obtained of the -***-abdomen during arterial, portal venous and delayed phases. Images of -***-the chest were obtained during the portal venous phase only. MIP, -***-coronal and sagittal reformats were provided for review.-***-Findings:-***-THORAX:-***-Evaluation of the visualized thyroid gland demonstrates several -***-hypodense thyroid nodules measuring up to 8 mm in the right lobe.-***-There is no pathologically enlarged axillary lymphadenopathy.  There -***-is an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node measuring 1.1 x 1.2 cm -***-in size [series 8, image 19].  Evaluation of the mediastinum -***-demonstrates several enlarged lymph nodes including a precarinal -***-lymph node which measures 1.7 by 1.2 cm in size [series 8, image 72], -***-a subcarinal lymph node which measures approximately 0.9 x 2.0 cm -***-[series 8, image 105] and a paraesophageal lymph node which measures -***-2.0 x 1.6 cm [series 8, image 172].  Abnormally enlarged internal -***-mammary lymph nodes are noted measuring up to 8 mm in short axis.  -***-There are enlarged cardiophrenic lymph nodes measuring 1.9 x 1.2 cm -***-[series 8, image 154].-***-The cardiac silhouette is within normal size limits. There is tumor -***-thrombus at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium.  -***-Incidental note of lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. -***-Significant coronary artery atherosclerotic disease is present.  -***-Aortic valvular calcifications are noted. No pericardial effusion. -***-The descending thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber and -***-demonstrates atherosclerosis. The esophagus and gastroesophageal -***-junction are grossly unremarkable. -***-The pulmonary artery is within normal size limits.  Evaluation of the -***-pulmonary arterial system is limited secondary to patient respiratory -***-motion and phase of contrast opacification, however there are -***-bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial filling -***-defects compatible with pulmonary emboli.  Given the tumor thrombus -***-within the right atrium, findings are compatible with tumor emboli.-***-There is a small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis -***-in the right lung base.   Evaluation of the lung parenchyma -***-demonstrates numerous bilateral, peripheral, round, pulmonary nodules -***-compatible with lung metastases.  The 3 largest pulmonary metastases -***-measure up 1.0 cm in the right upper lobe [series 8, image 55], -***-1.1-cm in the right middle lobe [series 8, image 137] and 1.0 cm in -***-the left upper lobe [series 8, image 47].  Dependent reticular and -***-ground glass opacities are suggestive of atelectasis.-***-ABDOMEN:-***-Evaluation of the liver demonstrates an 8.4 x 18.1 X 13.6 cm large, -***-heterogeneously enhancing hepatic mass invading the right hepatic -***-vein and inferior vena cava. The tumor thrombus terminates at the -***-junction of the right atrium with the inferior vena cava.  The middle -***-hepatic vein also appears invaded peripherally [series 7, image 85].  -***-The left hepatic vein remains patent.  The portal veins remain -***-patent.  The superior mesenteric and splenic veins are patent as -***-well.  The mass occupies segments 4A, 5, 7 and 8 and possibly extends -***-into segment 6. -***-Evaluation of the underlying liver demonstrates mild hypertrophy of -***-the left lateral segment and caudate lobe which may be seen in the -***-setting of cirrhosis or could potentially represent compensatory -***-hypertrophy of the uninvolved portions of the liver.  -***-A small amount of perihepatic fluid is present.-***-The patient is status post cholecystectomy. Clips are present in the -***-gallbladder fossa.  The common bile duct measures at least 10mm in -***-size but is within normal limits for patient's post cholecystectomy -***-state.-***-The adrenal glands are within normal limits.  -***-The spleen is normal in size, contour and attenuation. -***-The pancreas is within normal limits without evidence of mass or -***-ductal dilatation.-***-The kidneys are symmetric in size, contour, contrast enhancement and -***-excretion.  No focal renal mass, hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  -***-Punctate hypo-densities within the renal parenchyma are too small to -***-characterize, however statistically, likely represent renal cysts.-***-The stomach is grossly unremarkable. The imaged small bowel is within -***-normal limits without evidence of bowel wall thickening, hyperemia, -***-pneumatosis or obstruction.  The visualized colon is normal in course -***-and caliber.  Scattered diverticula are present without evidence of -***-diverticulitis.  The appendix is within normal limits.-***-The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber.  Mildly enlarged -***-abdominal lymph nodes are noted including a portal caval lymph node -***-measuring 3.2 x 2.4 cm [series 7, image 156] and a lesser sac lymph -***-node measuring up to 1.1 cm [series 12, image 69].-***-Evaluation of the visualized osseous structures demonstrates mild -***-diffuse osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes involving the -***-thoracolumbar spine.

The clinical -***-concern is for rupture of the pseudoaneurysm and for pulmonary -***-embolism.-***-TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial CT images of the chest were obtained before -***-and after the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast. -***-Postcontrast images were obtained with bolus triggering of the aorta -***-with extension of contrast administration to opacify both the aortic -***-and pulmonary circulation.-***-Additional images were obtained using an independent  workstation -***-including 3D, curved planar, maximum intensity projection images. -***-After a short delay, images were obtained through the level of the -***-kidneys.-***-FINDINGS: There is cardiomegaly. There is a left chest wall dual lead -***-pacer with the pacer wires in the right atrium and right ventricle. -***-There are stents within the left anterior descending and obtuse -***-marginal coronary arteries. Specific evaluation of the coronary -***-arteries is limited given the technique of this study. There is -***-atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta and its branches, -***-including  calcific and noncalcific atheroma. There is a penetrating -***-atherosclerotic ulcer at the aortic isthmus pointing inferolaterally -***-with a resultant pseudoaneurysm. The maximal dimension of the -***-pseudoaneurysm measure 70 x 72 mm, which is increased from about 65 x -***-56 mm on the December study. There is partial opacification of the -***-pseudoaneurysm consistent with pressurization. Evaluation of the -***-descending thoracic aorta demonstrates no evidence of dissection or -***-aneurysm. Incidental note is made of a focal dissection within the -***-abdominal aorta at the level of the kidneys, which is stable when -***-compared t the prior study. The aorta is not enlarged in this region. -***-There is subsegmental pulmonary embolism within the left lower lobe -***-posterobasal segments. There are no other pulmonary emboli. The -***-previously described right lung pulmonary emboli are not visualized -***-on the current study. There is no central pulmonary embolism. -***-There are moderate pericardial and small left pleural effusions again -***-demonstrated. There is atelectasis in the left lung base again -***-demonstrated. The lungs are clear of consolidation. There are -***-scattered areas of mucus plugging. The central airways are patent. -***-There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes which are not pathologic -***-by CT size criteria. There is no intrathoracic or axillary -***-lymphadenopathy. -***-The thyroid gland demonstrates heterogeneity and areas of hypodense -***-nodules. Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited by timing of -***-scope of contrast administration. Limited evaluation of the upper -***-abdomen demonstrates tiny hypodensities within the liver, which are -***-too small for definitive characterization but are stable from the -***-prior study. There is a vague contrast blush within the right lobe of -***-the liver next to the dome, which likely represents arteriovenous -***-shunting and was not definitely seen on the prior study. This lesion -***-is incompletely evaluated. -***-There are numerous tiny hyperdensities within the kidneys, -***-bilaterally. These are most compatible with simple cysts, though some -***-are too small for definitive characterization. Gallstones are again -***-demonstrated in the gallbladder. There is prominence of the left -***-adrenal gland and a tiny nodule in the right adrenal gland again -***-demonstrated and unchanged from as far back as December 2008. -***-Osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes.

Multiple axial and -***-coronal images created. Prior MRI from November 19, 2008 and chest -***-radiographs same  day reviewed. -***-FINDINGS:-***-CHEST: There is a large conglomerate left supraclavicular mass -***-measuring approximately 7 x 6 x 4.5 cm. This  occludes the left -***-internal jugular vein. The right jugular vein is patent. There is a -***-right upper extremity PICC with tip near the cavoatrial junction. The -***-lungs demonstrate innumerable round pulmonary nodules measuring up to -***-3 cm in size. They are noted diffusely throughout both lungs. Most of -***-the pulmonary metastases are concentrated in both lower lobes. There -***-are small bilateral pleural effusions without  evidence of pleural -***-thickening. There is mediastinal adenopathy, particularly subcarinal -***-in location. There are also enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes, as -***-well as anterior mediastinal lymph nodes. -***-Evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature demonstrates multiple -***-pulmonary emboli. There are filling defects within the branches of -***-the right lower lobe, right upper lobe, and left lower lobe.. There -***-is no significant pericardial fluid. The pulmonary artery is top -***-normal in size, measuring 31 mm in diameter. -***-Abdomen and pelvis: There are multiple small hypodense liver lesions -***-which are nonspecific but likely represent hepatic metastases as -***-well. The spleen is normal in size and is otherwise unremarkable. The -***-pancreas is unremarkable. The gallbladder is unremarkable. -***-There is a large bulky abdominal tumor with necrotic retrocrural -***-adenopathy and periaortic adenopathy and pelvic tumor extending into -***-the right lower pelvis. Conglomerate periaortic adenopathy measures -***-up to 18.5 cm in transverse dimension extending from left to right -***-and 28 cm in the craniocaudal extent.

There is high-density within the right renal -***-collecting system which may represent a hemorrhagic or proteinaceous -***-urine. Delayed images showed normal excretion from the left kidney -***-and minimal to no excretion from the right kidney.  There is bulky -***-adenopathy along the mesenteric vessels as well. Multiple right -***-retroperitoneal implants are also noted.-***-Evaluation of the vessels demonstrates thrombus extending from the -***-right common femoral vein and the left external iliac vein into the -***-IVC. Thrombus ascends up these vessels along the inferior vena cava -***-ascending to the level of the renal vein insertions. This likely -***-represents a combination of bland and/or tumor or thrombus. There is -***-a small right adrenal  metastasis. The left kidney is unremarkable. -***-There is narrowing of the right renal artery, likely due to -***-encasement and stretching by tumor. -***-The soft tissues demonstrate diffuse subcutaneous edema, especially -***-along the pelvis and lower extremities.

Prominent superifical-to-deep-***-communications are present which could reflect some venous-***-incompetency. Central pulmonary arteries are normal in size.-***-There is no pleural effusion or significant pulmonary infiltrate.-***-Multiple diffusely scattered small blebs are present in both lungs,-***-which are associated with areas of central bronchial wall-***-thickening. Several of these regions can be demonstrated on the-***-previous examination and could reflect a manifestation of reactive-***-airways disease or bronchitis. Tiny non-specific faint nodular-***-opacity in the right lung apex (series 2, image 316) is unchanged-***-from the prior examination.-***-The remainder of the examination is remarkable for mild enlargement-***-of the left ovary associated with a low attenuation focus (series-***-2, image 488) which is new from the prior examination and could be-***-small left ovarian cyst.

These include a left total pneumectomy and surgical-***-resection of multiple left ribs. Associated post surgical changes-***-that are noted include shortening of the anteroposterior diameter,-***-elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and mediastinal distortion-***-with mild effacement of the left atrium. Dilated stomach and colon-***-are again seen within the left hemithorax.-***-Note is again made of right paramediastinal post-radiation scarring-***-and extensive right upper lobe volume loss.

No new definite pulmonary nodules are-***-identified. However, there has been interval development of a new-***-right lower lobe superior segmental focus of ground glass opacity-***-centered about the subsegmental bronchus, raising the possibility-***-of infection or neoplasia. Another non specific focus of ground-***-glass opacity is seen about the right major fissure on image 178.-***-Several subcentimeter shotty precarinal lymph nodes are identified,-***-and a right hilar lymph node measuring approximately 7mm in short-***-axis is seen, not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.-***-Coronary calcification involving the right coronary, left main, and-***-left anterior descending vessels is noted. No pericardial or right-***-pleural effusion is identified. The aorta and supra-arch arteries-***-area normal in caliber, contour, and contrast filling. A short-***-segment occlusion of the left brachycephalic vein is identified,-***-although collateral venous return is present. This finding may-***-relate to prior radiation or surgery. No evidence is seen for-***-focal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. No deep-***-venous thrombosis of the lower extremities above the calves is-***-visualized.-***-Limited views of the abdomen demonstrate an unremarkable appearance-***-of the kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen. Distended-***-loops of large bowel and small bowel are again noted, with abundant-***-stool in the colon.

49909	ML_PE1479	300119030	24984	CT ANGIOGRAPHY CHEST- PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL:-***-INDICATION: Chest pain, pulmonary embolus.-***-TECHNIQUE:-***-Helically acquired overlapping 1.25 mm. slice thickness images were-***-obtained through the chest during the bolus administration of-***-intravenous contrast, timed to the pulmonary arterial phase-***-utilizing bolus triggering software. Delayed images were obtained-***-through the pelvis and both lower extremities to the level of the-***-knees for evaluation of the venous system.-***-FINDINGS:-***-Pulmonary arteries are well opacified and show no evidence of-***-filling defect to suggest acute pulmonary embolus. Delayed images-***-through the pelvis and both legs show no filling defects to suggest-***-deep venous thrombosis. In the right lung base (series 2, images-***-92-66) there is an ovoid area of moderate soft tissue opacity which-***-measures approximately 25 x 10 mm. This is seen immediately-***-adjacent to the large anterior- right lateral osteophyte from the-***-lower thoracic spine. This area could represent a focus of-***-atelectasis, in a similar but more linear atypical area of-***-subsegmental atelectasis is present in the left base (series 2,-***-image 93). However, the radiographic appearance is not entirely-***-diagnostic and a short term follow-up CT study at three months is-***-recommended.-***-There are mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes (series 2, images-***-249-214), the largest of which measures approximately 16 mm. short-***-axis. Other mildly prominent mediastinal nodes are present-***-throughout, not enlarged by CT size criteria. Also demonstrated on-***-series 2, image 225 is a mildly enlarged right hilar node measuring-***-14-15 mm. in short axis. These findings are nonspecific. The-***-remainder of the lungs is clear with the exception of mild-***-centrilobular air space opacity in the lung bases, which is-***-nonspecific. A mildly prominent azygos venous system is also-***-demonstrated.-***-The remainder of the visualized structures of the pelvis are-***-unremarkable with the exception of a tiny ventral hernia (series 2,-***-image 508) and non- visualization of the uterus which is presumably-***-post- surgical. There is moderate arterial calcification of the-***-common femoral and superficial femoral arteries bilaterally. Mild-***-distal aortic calcification is also present.-***-A nonspecific low density lesion in the lower aspect of the right-***-lobe of the thyroid gland is also demonstrated (series 2, image-***-383). Several other tiny low density lesions are also seen in both-***-lobes. The findings are nonspecific but could represent goiter.-***-Clinical correlation is recommended.

The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- -***-or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size -***-and other factors.-***-FINDINGS:-***-VASCULATURE:-***-The heart size is normal without a pericardial effusion. Again seen -***-at the level of the ligament arteriosum, a right intercostal artery -***-has a prominent infundibular origin which branches to give rise to -***-additional paravertebral arteries. These additional branches are -***-better seen on this study due to technical factors. There is no -***-hematoma, fat stranding, pleural effusion, or contrast leak to -***-suggest acute vascular injury. Otherwise, the aorta is normal in -***-course and caliber. The main pulmonary artery is normal in course and -***-caliber. While not a dedicated pulmonary embolism study, no filling -***-defects are seen in the main or lobar pulmonary arteries to suggest -***-pulmonary embolism.-***-CHEST:-***-The thyroid gland is unremarkable. The heart is normal in size. There -***-is no pericardial effusion. There are mild coronary arterial -***-calcifications.The lungs are clear without nodules, masses or -***-consolidations.

After the uneventful administration of -***-IV contrast, contiguous axial images were acquired through the heart -***-with retrospective cardiac gating.  Additional contiguous axial -***-images through the chest performed in venous delayed phase.  -***-Multiplanar and 3-D reformats were performed on an independent -***-workstation.-***-FINDINGS:-***-The thyroid gland and supraclavicular spaces are unremarkable.-***-Noncontrast imaging to the heart shows no significant calcifications -***-in the coronary arteries.  There is evidence of interval mechanical -***-aortic valvular replacement.  -***-The heart is prominent in size as before.  No pericardial effusion.  -***-Apical myocardial thinning with associated apical calcification -***-consistent with small apical aneurysm is not significantly changed.  -***-No adjacent low-density filling defect to suggest an associated -***-thrombus.  -***-Interval placement of a tubular graft of the ascending aorta -***-extending to the transverse aorta.  Several hyperdense pledgets are -***-demonstrated in the vicinity of the ascending aortic graft.  There is -***-a small intermediate to low-density fluid collection around the -***-ascending aorta tubular graft, the superior extent extending to the -***-distal transverse arch and the inferior extent at the level of the -***-aortic root.  The periaortic fluid collection extends anteriorly with -***-a retrosternal component superiorly (4/133).  The retrosternal -***-component extends in the caudal direction to the level of the xiphoid -***-process.  Delayed imaging demonstrates rim enhancement around these -***-fluid collections.  The aorta is more normalized in caliber with -***-preliminary measurements as follows: 34 mm in the immediate -***-supravalvular aorta, up to 34 mm in the mid ascending aorta, 28 mm in -***-the proximal transverse arch, 18 mm in the distal transverse arch -***-distal to the tubular graft, and 23 mm in the descending thoracic -***-aorta.  Final measurements will be provided by the 3-D laboratory and -***-an addendum will be issued.  A patent side-to-side anastomosis is -***-demonstrated attaching to the left inferior aortic tubular graft with -***-the anteriorly coursing limb anastomosed to the right coronary artery -***-and the posterolateral coursing limb anastomosed to the proximal left -***-anterior descending artery and proximal left circumflex artery.  No -***-evidence of leak.-***-The main pulmonary artery is normal in course and caliber.  While not -***-a dedicated pulmonary embolism study, no filling defects are seen in -***-the main or lobar pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.-***-New right greater than left lower lobe atelectasis in addition to -***-lingular atelectasis.  There is subtotal atelectasis of the right -***-lower lobe.  There is subpleural fluid nonenhancing focus in the -***-right lower lobe (4/228) which is of uncertain clinical significance.  -***-New small right pleural effusion.  Stable nonspecific 2-mm right -***-upper lobe pulmonary nodule (4/97) and 2 mm subpleural left upper -***-lobe pulmonary nodule  (4/321) since 05/13/11.  No pneumothorax.

Rule out pulmonary embolism.  Rule out aortic dissection.-***-COMPARISON:  None.-***-TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced and enhanced axial CT images of the chest, -***-abdomen and pelvis from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen with -***-additional thin slice reconstructions per CT angiography protocol -***-were obtained prior to and following uneventful intravenous contrast -***-administration.  Additional minimum intensity projection, -***-three-dimensional and multiplanar reformatted imaging was obtained on -***-an independent 3D workstation and reviewed.  -***-FINDINGS:  There are multiple, predominantly subsegmental filling -***-defects within multiple right lower lobe and right middle lobe -***-pulmonary arterial branches, consistent with emboli.  No central -***-pulmonary embolism is identified.  No aortic dissection is -***-identified.  -***-There is significant atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta, -***-including calcifications and multiple irregular atheromas.  There is -***-mild to moderate coronary artery calcification.  The left anterior -***-descending coronary artery wraps around the apex of the heart.  -***-Calcification of the aortic valve is noted.  There is enlargement of -***-the left atrium and mild enlargement of the left ventricle.  Mildly -***-decreased perfusion involving the subendocardial portion of the left -***-ventricular apical wall is suggestive of infarction.  A right -***-axillary arterial catheter and a left internal jugular central venous -***-catheter are noted.  The heart and thoracic vasculature are otherwise -***-unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There is -***-mediastinal lymphadenopathy, of unclear etiology.  These measure up -***-to 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the para-aortic region, 1.5 cm in the right -***-paratracheal region, 0.9 cm in the precarinal region.  Extensive, -***-more confluent lymphadenopathy is visualized within the subcarinal -***-and bilateral hilar regions.  In the right axilla, there is a -***-somewhat ill-defined mass which measures 3.6 x 2.9 cm on axial image -***-64 of series 4.  This is also of unclear etiology and may represent a -***-hematoma given the central line in this region.  However, a nodal -***-mass is also not excluded.  -***-Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates fairly extensive, -***-scattered ground glass opacification, some of which appear -***-geographic.  The appearance is nonspecific, with differential -***-including atypical infection, drug reaction and edema.  Predominantly -***-lower lobe, mild intralobular septal thickening suggests a component -***-of mild pulmonary edema.  Dependent changes are noted bilaterally as -***-well as trace pleural effusions.  Within the right lung base, there -***-are two more focal, peripheral consolidations which may represent -***-atelectasis, though infection, and in this setting, infarction are -***-also possible.  Paraseptal emphysema is visualized mostly within the -***-upper lobes.  -***-A limb of the left adrenal gland appears thickened and nodular.  The -***-right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  The liver, gallbladder, right -***-kidney, spleen, pancreas and visualized bowel are unremarkable.  A -***-hypodense and too small to characterize left renal lesion is present.  -***-The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable without hydronephrosis.  There -***-is no significant free fluid or free air.  No abnormal abdominal or -***-pelvic adenopathy is identified.  There is a Foley catheter -***-presumably within a decompressed urinary bladder.  Post-procedure -***-stranding within the left groin is incidentally noted.  There is no -***-focal fluid collection.  The uterus and adnexa are within normal -***-limits.  A few colonic diverticula are noted.  -***-There are numerous post-surgical clips present within the abdomen and -***-pelvis.  Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal and pelvic -***-vasculature is noted.  There is a short segment, 2.2 x 1.9 cm -***-infrarenal focal abdominal aortic ectasia.  A few aortic atheromas -***-are noted.  There is an accessory left hepatic artery.  The SMA and -***-celiac artery are patent.  There is a short, focal and significant -***-stenosis of the proximal left renal artery, approximately 1 cm from -***-the origin.  Mild, likely less than 50% stenosis of the proximal -***-right renal artery is also noted.  The left common iliac artery is -***-chronically occluded, with distal reconstitution of the left external -***-and internal iliac arteries.-***-There are mild degenerative changes throughout the visualized osseous -***-structures, which are otherwise unremarkable.  -***-IMPRESSION:-***-1.

The patient-***-recently presented with infection that was complicated by-***-hemoptysis. She underwent trans-catheter embolization without-***-significant improvement. Current study obtained and follow-up.-***-TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the chest-***-during the intravenous infusion of contrast, using 1.25 mm slice-***-thickness. Imaging of the pelvis and lower extremities was-***-performed during the venous phase. The study was interpreted on a-***-3D work station using ZR, MIP, NPR visualization techniques.-***-FINDINGS:-***-Comparison was made to prior study dated 09/30/2005, as well as-***-05/17/2006.-***-The pulmonary angiogram demonstrates multiple small peripheral-***-microaneurysms which appear to be along the left lateral and-***-posterior pleural surfaces. These were thought to most likely-***-originate from systemic arterial collaterals rather than pulmonary-***-arteries as there is a very high grade stenosis of the left main-***-pulmonary artery. In addition, there is preferential bronchial-***-arterial hypertrophy supplying the left lung as well as multiple-***-large entercostals on the left side compared to the right. These-***-most likely represent large transpleural arterial supply to these-***-microaneurysms. The left pulmonary veins are also very small and-***-scarred, especially the superior branches.-***-On the right side, there is medialization of the hilar structures-***-secondary to scarring. There is a 1 cm filling defect within the-***-right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arterial branch which may-***-represent a pulmonary embolus. Evaluation of the more peripheral-***-pulmonary arterial branches is limited by motion artifact. The-***-aortic arch is on the right. There is an aberrant, retroesophageal-***-left subclavian artery which demonstrates multi-focal stenoses-***-along its course. The appearance is also most consistent with that-***-of post-radiation changes.-***-Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates consolidation in the superior-***-segment of the right lower lobe and posterior segments of the right-***-upper lobe. The right middle lobe and anterior basal segment of-***-the right lower lobe are aerated. It demonstrates multiple-***-centrilobular nodules which may represent infection. On the left,-***-there is occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus. When compared-***-with the prior study of 05/17/2006, the previously seen-***-emphysematous areas are now consolidated. In addition, there is-***-blurring of the tissue planes, with loss of distinction between the-***-mediastinal structures and the left lung. There are now large-***-areas of low attenuation material consistent with fluid, and may-***-represent drowned lungs. There is a paucity of opacified vessels-***-within the left lung.-***-There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.-***-Multiple areas of calcifications are noted within the left pleural-***-space which may represent prior pleurodesis.-***-An endotracheal tube is in place as well as a nasogastric tube.-***-There is an arterial line in the right femoral artery, terminating-***-in the proximal right internal iliac artery.

The previously -***-identified left upper lobe anterolateral area of ground-glass opacity -***-has decreased ground-glass attenuation but appears slightly more -***-dense.  This is seen best on series 2, image 91.  Attention to this -***-region should be given on followup examination.  There are also areas -***-of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe near the right -***-hemidiaphragm, which are likely atelectasis but this is a -***-non-specific finding.  There is also mild increase in the patchy -***-right middle lobe disease adjacent to the major fissure, which may be -***-due to scarring.  -***- Again seen is an 11 mm size supraclavicular lymph node on series 2, -***-image 37, this is unchanged.-***- The patient is noted to have a small subsegmental right lower lobe -***-pulmonary embolus which is seen best on series 2, image 150.  -***- ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Evaluation of the liver again demonstrates two -***-hypodense lesions compatible with the patient's known metastatic -***-disease.  The larger lesion is in segment 2 and 4A and measures 5.9 x -***-5.5 cm, seen best on series 7, image 49.  This is unchanged.  Also, -***-there is a 2.5 x 2.6 cm low density mass in the right lobe of the -***-liver, segment 6, this is also unchanged.  There are no new hepatic -***-lesions.  The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  There is no -***-intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

Coronal reformations were performed.-***-FINDINGS:-***-CHEST:  There is redemonstration of multiple enlarged lymph nodes-***-noted within the visualized lower portions of the neck, mediastinum,-***-hila, bilateral axilla, and subpectoral regions that are relatively-***-unchanged from the prior study.  The dominant representative lymph-***-nodes in the short axis are as follows:  lower left cervical neck-***-measuring 11 mm, right infraclavicular measuring 16 mm, left-***-subpectoral measuring 9 mm, 16 mm left axillary lymph node, 14 mm and-***-15 mm right axillary lymph nodes, 11 mm prevascular lymph node, and-***-16 mm right hilar lymph node.  The heart is within normal limits for-***-size.  No pericardial effusion.-***-There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is an adjacent-***-area of consolidation within the left lower lobe with air-***-bronchograms that may represent pneumonia. Additionally, there is a-***-small amount of patchy airspace disease in the most inferior aspect-***-of the right upper lobe.-***-There are stable, noncalcified pulmonary nodules: fissural nodule on-***-the right best appreciated on series 3, image 166 measuring 5 mm, and-***-left upper lobe fissural nodule best appreciated on series 3, image-***-128 measuring approximately 3 mm.  Additionally, there is a stable-***-right middle lobe granuloma.-***-ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  Redemonstration of two stable low attenuation-***-lesions within the liver which are too small to characterize, one-***-within the posterior segment of the right lobe and one within the-***-liver dome. The liver is otherwise unremarkable without evidence of-***-intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. Gallbladder is unremarkable.-***-Common bile duct normal in caliber. Stable mild fatty atrophy of the-***-pancreas, but otherwise pancreas is unremarkable.

65001	ML_PE3066	300311853	24739	CT OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: 6/2/2004-***-CLINICAL DATA: 64-year-old female with infected left hip; known-***-left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis; left groin mass; rule-***-out vascular compromise and pulmonary embolus.-***-TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast images were obtained of the chest, abdomen-***-and pelvis. Following the uneventful administration of intravenous-***-contrast, contiguous axial thin-section images were obtained of the-***-chest, abdomen, pelvis and bilateral lower extremities in the-***-angiographic phase.-***-FINDINGS: Mild aortoiliac and bilateral femoral artery-***-atherosclerotic changes are demonstrated. The ascending aorta is-***-mildly prominent (measuring 37mm). The transverse aorta, supra-arch-***-arteries and descending thoracic aorta are within normal limits for-***-size.-***-Although angiographic phase images are optimized for the systemic-***-vascular, the main, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries are-***-well opacified, patent and negative for thrombus bilaterally.-***-A left PICC, small left Bochdalek hernia and right axillary clips-***-are incidentally noted.-***-The celiac axis, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric-***-arteries are patent and of normal caliber. Two right renal arteries-***-are demonstrated with calcified plaque at the origin of the-***-inferior right renal artery without evidence of significant-***-stenosis. Three left renal arteries are demonstrated with two small-***-inferior accessory renal arteries without evidence of significant-***-stenosis. Renal enhancement is prompt and symmetric bilaterally-***-without evidence of perfusion abnormality. Multiple tiny peripheral-***-low attenuation lesions are present within both kidneys, the-***-majority of which are too small to further characterize. A small-***-low attenuation lesion near the dome of the liver is also too small-***-to further characterize.-***-Postoperative changes of bilateral total hip arthroplasty are-***-demonstrated with multifocal complex fluid collection adjacent to-***-the left hip. The fluid collection along the medial aspect of the-***-left iliac bone, adjacent to the left iliopsoas musculature causes-***-mild medial displacement of the adjacent left external iliac artery-***-without evidence of arterial compromise. Allowing for differences-***-in technique, this collection is not significantly changed since-***-abdomen and pelvis CT from 5/31/2004. A 64 x 38mm collection within-***-the left gluteal musculature (series 3, image #575) has developed-***-since the prior scan and may represent reaccumulation of-***-postoperative collection, possibly with superimposed infection. A-***-2mm contrast collection is present within the medial left iliopsoas-***-musculature (series 3, image #531), which likely represents a focal-***-intramuscular pseudoaneurysm. Mild expansion of the adjacent-***-iliopsoas musculature suggests some degree of prior hemorrhage,-***-which is unchanged since the prior examination.-***-Extensive left lower extremity swelling and soft tissue edema is-***-again demonstrated, some of which is likely related to previously-***-described left femoral deep venous thrombosis (not well visualized-***-on today's examination due to imaged phase of contrast-***-enhancement).-***-Mild bilateral infrainguinal atherosclerotic changes are-***-demonstrated. Normal right lower extremity arterial runoff is-***-demonstrated with three vessels runoff to the ankle and two vessel-***-flow to the foot via the dorsalis pedis and distal posterior tibial-***-arteries.-***-The left common femoral, superficial femoral, and deep femoral-***-arteries are patent and of normal caliber. The left popliteal-***-artery is patent without evidence of significant stenosis. Mild--***-moderate infrapopliteal arterial disease is demonstrated with-***-multifocal areas of moderate-high grade stenosis and intermittent-***-focal occlusions of the mid-distal left anterior tibial artery. The-***-anterior division of the left peroneal artery reconstitutes the-***-left AT above the ankle, which crosses into the foot to supply the-***-dorsalis pedis artery. The distal left posterior tibial artery is-***-patent across the ankle and into the foot, where it supplies the-***-majority of the deep plantar arch.-***-Findings discussed with Dr. Richard Hsu from the referring service.-***-IMPRESSION:-***-1.

There is-***-mild atelectasis of the lung adjacent to the pleural effusion.-***-There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening. A few scattered mucous-***-plugs are seen in the right apex.-***-MEDIASTINUM: There are severe calcifications in the left anterior-***-descending coronary artery. The patient has had a prior CABG with-***-surgical clips seen in the mediastinum. The left internal mammary-***-artery is not visualized, probably secondary to harvesting from the-***-CABG.-***-The hilar lymph nodes are prominent bilaterally.-***-ABDOMEN: There is a 4.4 x 3.4 cm fluid collection within the left-***-rectus muscle, seen on image 320, series 2, with hyperdense fluid-***-within it that most probably represents hematoma. In addition,-***-inferiorly, in the anterior abdominal wall, there is a large fluid-***-collection filled with hyperdense material measuring 4.7 x 9.0 cm-***-that again probably represents a hematoma. There is another very-***-small fluid collection within the anterior abdominal fat, seen on-***-image 322, series 2, measuring 1.5 x 1.8 cm, that also probably-***-represents a focal hematoma. The patient has a history of Lovenox-***-injections at this site.-***-There is evidence of mild mesenteric stranding throughout the-***-abdomen. The bladder wall appears thickened. There is a Foley in-***-place.-***-BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: In the region of the right knee, there is-***-a large fluid collection surrounding the remnant of the knee,-***-measuring at least 6.8 cm in diameter. This fluid collection is-***-filled with hyperdense material as well as hypodense fluid--***-intensity material. This probably represents the sequela of the-***-known hemarthrosis. The knee joint shows severe bony disruption,-***-consistent with the history of prosthetic removal. There is-***-generalized soft-tissue edema around the knee. There is some rim-***-enhancement of the fluid collection in the knee, and we cannot-***-exclude infection on this limited CT scan.

Presented to outside hospital where a pulmonary-***-embolism study was done which repotedly showed a type B aortic-***-dissection as well as pulmonary embolism. This study was done for-***-further evaluation.-***-TECHNIQUE:-***-2.5 mm contrast enhanced images using pulmonary embolism protocol-***-performed at Sutter Medical Center, Santa Rosa, scanned into this-***-study under the same accession number. This is series 4 in our-***-study. At Stanford, 2.5 mm axial images were obtained through the-***-chest, abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast.-***-Subsequently, 1.25 mm retrospectively ECG gated axial images-***-through the chest were obtained and continued into the abdomen and-***-pelvis. Delayed images were then obtained through the chest.-***-Image quality of the arterial phase is limited secondary to poor-***-bolus timing. Images were reviewed on a 3D workstation, and-***-subsequently reformatted images were supplied by the 3D laboratory.-***-FINDINGS:-***-Endotracheal tube is present with tip above the level of the-***-carina.-***-AORTA:-***-There is bovine aortic arch anatomy. A type B aortic dissection is-***-demonstrated. The entry tear is likely located in the distal-***-thoracic or proximal abdominal aorta with propogation both-***-retrograde and anterograde. The most proximal extent of the-***-dissection is in the proximal descending aorta distal to the take-***-off of the left subclavian artery. Compared with the prior outside-***-study, the previously demonstrated fenestration and slight contrast-***-enhancement within the false lumen is no longer present. There is-***-no flow demonstrated in the false lumen, neither on arterial phase-***-nor in delayed phase consistent with thrombosis of the false lumen.-***-This thrombosed false lumen extends inferiorly to the level of the-***-hiatus where there is an abrupt transition to patent true and false-***-luminae with near complete intimal separation and a free floating-***-true lumen. The maximum dimension of the descending thoracic aorta-***-at the level of the pulmonary arteries measures 2.7 x 2.9 cm.-***-Within the abdomen, the celiac artery arises from the true lumen.-***-The celiac origin is narrowed, but this is by the median arcuate-***-ligament, not due to the dissection. The superior mesenteric-***-artery arises from the true lumen. The inferior mesenteric artery-***-also arises from the true lumen. There are two right renal-***-arteries and two left renal arteries, both of which arise from the-***-true lumen. The dissection propagates distally and extends into-***-both common iliac arteries. There is thrombosis of the false lumen-***-of the right common iliac artery beginning at its origin. This-***-thrombosis extends to the distal right common iliac artery where-***-the dissection terminates. The true lumen in the right common-***-iliac artery is markedly compressed by the thrombosed false lumen.-***-There is extensive atheroma of the right external iliac artery.-***-Within the left common iliac artery the dissection propagates to-***-the middle of the vessel where it terminates.-***-THE REMAINDER OF THE CHEST:-***-There is prominent back filling of left paravertebral veins but no-***-evidence of venous anatomic obstruction.

The CTDI and DLP may -***-therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's -***-absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.-***- FINDINGS:-***- Scattered prominent mediastinal lymph nodes including a right -***-paratracheal node measuring approximately 1 cm in short axis diameter -***-are unchanged since August 2011. There is no evidence of new or -***-worsening axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy by CT size -***-criteria.-***- Trachea and central bronchi are patent. Two sub-centimeter pulmonary -***-parenchymal nodules in the right lower lobe measuring 5 mm each are -***-stable dating back to August 2011.

Aneurysmal dilatation of the distal -***-ascending thoracic aorta is again seen measuring 5.5 x 6.0 cm on -***-non-orthogonal axial images (series 4 image 84). Post surgical -***-changes are again demonstrated in the abdominal aorta compatible with -***-prior thoracoabdominal aortic graft repair for dissection and -***-aneurysm. Grafted abdominal arterial branches again appear tortuous -***-but remain patent. Aneurysmal dilatation of the left common iliac -***-artery is again seen measuring up to 2.8 cm.-***- Study was not optimized for evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature; -***-however no gross filling defects are identified to suggest large -***-central pulmonary emboli. IVC and hepatic veins are patent. Superior -***-mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and portal veins are patent. No -***-evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.-***- Liver is normal in size and contour without multiple unchanged cysts -***-at hypoattenuating lesions too small to characterize. No evidence of -***-intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Gallbladder -***-appears distended without wall thickening similar to the prior exam.-***- Stomach is now completely below the diaphragm compatible with -***-interval reduction of diaphragmatic hernia and gastropexy.

Numerous pulmonary nodules involving-***-all lobes are seen, ranging from subcentimeter size up to 2.3 cm-***-(right upper lobe, image 250 of series 2). Comparison with the-***-images of the lung base from the prior study of October 20th, 2005-***-suggests likely interval progression of pulmonary nodules since the-***-prior study. There has been interval development of a moderate to-***-large right pleural effusion, associated with approximately 50%-***-atelectasis of the right lower lobe and additional milder-***-atelectatic changes of the right middle lobe. The airways appear-***-essentially patent. Shotty axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes are-***-identified, none of which meets CT size criteria for pathologic-***-significance. The heart appears normal in size, although displaced-***-to the left by subphrenic disease.-***-Within the visualized portions of the abdomen, there is-***-redemonstration of enlargement of the liver, with near complete-***-replacement of the right hepatic lobe by heterogeneous masses,-***-consistent with known hepatocellular carcinoma. The degree of-***-disease appears progressed since the prior study of October 20th,-***-2005. There is redemonstration of discrete high attenuation-***-material within the masses, consistent with prior-***-chemoembolization. Associated with the masses, there is associated-***-compression of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava, as well as the-***-suprahepatic inferior vena cava, with venous return through the-***-azygous and hemiazygous system.

Rule out pulmonary embolus.-***-COMPARISON: None.-***-TECHNIQUE: Multiple 1.25 mm axial images of the chest were-***-obtained with subsequent 5 mm axial images from the IVC bifurcation-***-to the deep venous system of the lower extremities after IV-***-contrast administration.-***-FINDINGS: The pulmonary artery trunk is markedly enlarged-***-measuring 4.2 cm in diameter. The right and left main pulmonary-***-arteries as well as the peripheral branches are also enlarged-***-relative to their accompanying bronchi consistent with pulmonary-***-hypertension and shunt vascularity. There is a normal distribution-***-of the pulmonary arteries without filling defects. A normal-***-appearing left-sided aortic arch is present and the aorta is normal-***-in caliber and appearance throughout its course. The right and-***-left coronary arteries are patent and arise from the aorta. The-***-supra-aortic great vessels are normal in caliber with an aberrant-***-right subclavian artery present which takes off the distal-***-transverse aortic arch at the fourth branch and courses posterior-***-to the trachea and esophagus without mass effect on the trachea.-***-The pulmonary veins are normal in caliber and take a normal course-***-draining into the left atrium. A right-sided SVC drains to the-***-anterior right atrium. A morphologic right ventricle and left-***-ventricle are present with normal cardiac status. There is marked-***-right ventricular hypertrophy associated with the large-***-perimembranous ventricular septal defect measuring approximately 2-***-cm in size. Additionally, two small muscular ventricular septal-***-communications are visualized. The endocardial cushion is intact.-***-There is associated slight atrial enlargement with normal left-***-atrial size. Due to artifact, whether an intra-atrial-***-communication is present cannot be evaluated. No pericardial-***-effusion.-***-The lung parenchyma demonstrates diffuse subtle ground-glass-***-opacities in a centrilobular distribution which could be secondary-***-to pulmonary hypertension versus foci of microhemorrhage,-***-infection, or inflammation/hypersensitivity. There are also-***-consolidated opacities, most marked peripherally within the left-***-lower lobe surrounded by ground-glass opacity which also involves-***-the lingula and superior portion of the left upper lobe to a lesser-***-extent, which is worrisome for aspiration versus infection and this-***-is most likely to represent a pulmonary infarct given lack of-***-pulmonary embolus. No pleural effusions are present.-***-Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple small foci-***-of hypervascularity within the partially visualized liver, the-***-largest of which measures 1.4 cm and is located within the anterior-***-portion of the right hepatic lobe (image 37, series 2).
