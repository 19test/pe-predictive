For these results we used [scikit-learn count vectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) to perform text tokenization and preprocessing, and then used [scikit-learn ensemble trees](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier) to do the prediction. The full script for the analysis [is available](https://github.com/radinformatics/pe-predictive/blob/master/classifiers/2.countVectorizer.py), and dependencies are handled via running it in its [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/pe-predictive/)"
